### MicroBit Event Queue

Authors: Christian Torralba, Barton Massey

#### Brief Idea/Purpose

A quick intro to this to just keep track of user interaction with the microbit. This means button presses, microphone pickup etc.
The program will keep track of the event and when it occurred using a timer.
